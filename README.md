# Break My Password

A while ago in a circle of friends, one of us suggested a game. Which consisted of the challenger thinking of a 4-digit password. And the rest of us have to guess.

But with one detail. It will only tell you how many numbers are correct if they are in the right place. Each person speaks once, for example:
The challenger thought of the password 1234. Player A comes up with 6270, so the challenger says: A correct number, as number 2 is in the same position. And the suggestions continue for Player B, C... Until the wheel starts again and the challenger's password is correct. Ideally, everyone should be paying close attention to the numbers and even writing them down.

Well, this is a Python version of the game that entertained me and my friends for a whole night.
